monday 
morning session
-basics of low power design and different power reduction techniques
-special cells used in low power design
-power switches,isolation cells,level shifters,retention register,always on logic

afternoon session
-introduction to upf,upf flow,
-basic concepts of upf explained using an example
-different components of upf,fuctional vs power intent
-design vs logic hierarchy 
-different commands to be used to set the different components in the upf file

tuesday
morning session
-identification of different  power domains for a design
-how to create a upf file and set the for an example design
-upf power state table,isolation strategy,creating level shifters,create retention registers
-vclp introduction and its key features
-how to create vclp.tcl file  

afternoon session
-we worked on low power labs 
-In lab1 we worked on isolation type cells with three power domains

wednesday
morning session
-in lab2 we worked on isolation type cells with different error but same design as before 
-in lab3 we worked on isolation type cells with different error but same design as before 
afternoon session
-we worked on level shifter labs
-in lab1 we worked on level shifter labs where we needed to use level shifters for a signal passing between different power domains
-lab2,lab3,lab4,lab5,lab6 same as lab1(all of them were minor errors)
-lab4 related to isolation type cells (where she asked us to solve all the 69 errors)
